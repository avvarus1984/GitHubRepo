<p style="margin: 30px;">Especially for English Language Lovers..
    Can any one tell the difference between 'Completed' and 'Finished'?
    No dictionary has ever been able to define the difference between 'Complete' and 'Finished.'
    However, in a linguistic conference, held in London England, Hasan Javaid, was the clever winner.
    His final challenge was this. His response was: When you marry the right woman, you are 'Complete.'
    If you marry the wrong woman, you are 'Finished.' And , when the right woman catches you with the wrong woman,
    you are 'Completely Finished.'
    His answer received a five minute standing ovation😝😅😆😂</p>
